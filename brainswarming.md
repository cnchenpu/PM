- Disadvantage of brainstroming:
  - Single person or small groups may dominate the whole process just because they are more extroverted.
  - We tend to rehash, reword and build off existing ideas.

# Brainswarming

__Basic Idea: The goal (the problem need to solve) and the available resource meets in a solution.__

1. Do not define problem but goal.
2. Goal is pinned on top of the board.
3. The resources are pinned at the bottom.
4. Top-down thinkers will refine the goal and define their ideas from the top.
5. Buttom-up thinker will use the resources to start thinking about how the problems can be solved.
    * New resource can be added on bottom.
6. Important rule: don't talk, just write all ideas on Post-it notes.
7. All collected ideas are pinned to the board.
8. Connect between resources and ideas.
