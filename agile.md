# The Scrum Guide
Scrum is an agile software development process for iteratively managing product development. 
Requirements and solutions evolve through collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams. 
With Scrum, teams deliver early, and then continuously improve and adjust their product in response to changing requirements. 
This method of development helps the team build a solution that solves the customer’s need rather than just meet the initial requirements.

# The Scrum Team
A Scrum team is a cross-functional self-directed team: a group of people with varying expertise working together towards a common goal.

## Product Owner
The Product Owner represents the customer. 
She is responsible of making sure that the team delivers value to the business. 
There can only be one Product Owner in a Scrum team, that person could also be a developer on the team, but may not also be the Scrum Master.

The Product Owner needs strong communication skills, as she represents the stakeholders to the team, and the team to the stakeholders. 
She understands the customer and business well, and creates tasks for the Product Backlog that deliver to the customer’s needs. 
She prioritizes and organizes sprint releases and ensures that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear.
<br>
Her responsibilities include negotiating priorities, scope, funding, and schedule, educating stakeholders in the development process, organizing milestones reviews, communicating status, announcing releases, and demonstrating the solution to stakeholders.

## Scrum Master
The Scrum Master is the servant-leader of the team. 
She ensures that all the team’s needs are being met, and removes any distracting influences to help them move at full speed. 
She enforces the rules of Scrum, and challenges the team to improve. 
For examples her responsibilities include determining the definition of done for a project, and promoting self-organization within the team.

## Development Team
The development teams is a cross-sectional team that does the actual work of delivering a potentially shippable product (PSI) at the end of each sprint. They do the analysis, design, development, tests, QA, documentation and all that is need to deliver the product. 
The team size ranges from 3 to 9 individuals.

# The Scrum Process
The goal in Scrum is to deliver early and often: starting with a minimum product and continuously improving it with customer and stakeholder feedback.
The process of delivering a product in Scrum, is via iterations called sprints. 
At the end of each sprint, a potentially shippable product is delivered.
At the beginning of each sprint, the team decides on the Sprint backlog, a section of the Product Backlog that they will deliver in a sprint.

## Product Backlog
The Product Backlog is the list of requirements for the product.
It contains everything that needs to be done: features, bug fixes, technical work, knowledge acquisition, etc.
The product backlog is the responsibility of the Product Owner who maintains it based on his communication with the stakeholders and the team.
The Product Backlog is initially drafted by the Product Owner based on her understanding of the requirements, the work involved, and the priorities.

## Backlog refinement meeting
- Management tasks.
- Move tasks between sprints

## Sprint
The team starts each sprint starts with a planning meeting where the team decides on the tasks to be worked on during that sprint. 
The team ends the sprint with a review meeting and a retrospective meeting.

## Sprint Backlog
The Sprint Backlog is a part of the backlog that the development team must deliver by the end of the sprint. 
During a sprint no one can add tasks to the sprint backlog except for the development team themselves.
